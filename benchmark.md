title: Cottle - Benchmark
---

Methodology
===========

Benchmark contents
---

This page contains parsing and rendering benchmark of Cottle compared to other
template engines, using [BenchmarkDotNet](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet)
library.

**Parsing** benchmark measures the time needed to transform a template stored
as a string into an in-memory object that can be passed input data for
rendering. This part is usually the most time consuming, which is why result
should be cached by client application.

**Rendering** benchmark measures the time needed to render a parsed template
into a string output, taking variable input data at render time.

Same template source code was used for both benchmarks and adapted to every
template engine library. Here is the Cottle version of this source code:

```sh
<ul id='products'>
  {for product in products:
    <li>
      <h2>{product.name}</h2>
      <p>{slice(product.description, 0, 15)} - Only {format(product.price, "n:f1", "en-US")}$</p>
    </li>
  }
</ul>
```

Template is then rendered with an input context built with an array of 5 items
as the `products` variable. Full benchmark source code can be found
[here](https://github.com/r3c/cottle/blob/master/src/Cottle.Benchmark/Inputs/CompareEngine.cs).

Discussion
==========

About Cottle
---

Cottle performance was measured using default document compiler (method
`Document.CreateDefault`). Rendering performance can be boosted by switching to
[native](https://cottle.readthedocs.io/en/stable/page/05-advanced.html#native-documents)
document compiler (method `Document.CreateNative`) instead, while compilation
time can be significantly reduced by
[disabling code optimizer](https://cottle.readthedocs.io/en/stable/page/04-configuration.html#optimizer-deactivation)
at the cost of a higher rendering time. Both these alternative configurations
were not included in the benchmark to avoid multiplying comparison points.


About Mustachio
---

Function calls could not be adapted to Mustachio benchmark due to the
logic-less approach of the library. These functions were however required for
formatting price floating point values to strings, so source code for Mustachio
is not a 1:1 equivalent to the reference version. Formatting was pre-applied in
C# code instead, resulting in an artificial slight performance boost in favor
of Mustachio due to this processing not being considered as part of the
measurement.
