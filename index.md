Overview
========

Cottle is an open-source (MIT) templating engine for C# .NET designed to be
light (no external dependency & simple API), fast (see
[benchmark](./benchmark.html)) and extensible (see
[advanced features](https://cottle.readthedocs.io/en/stable/page/05-advanced.html)).
Cottle language and C# API look like this:

```sh
{library} is a great library to {["discover", "learn", "use"][rand(0, 3)]}!
```

```cs
var document = Document.CreateDefault(template).DocumentOrThrow;

return document.Render(Context.CreateBuiltin(new Dictionary<Value, Value>
{
    ["library"] = "Cottle"
}));
```

```
Cottle is a great library to learn!
```


Getting started
===============

[User documentation](https://cottle.readthedocs.io/) is available at Read the
Docs and explains how to use the library with many code snippets and examples.

[Performance benchmark](./benchmark.html) against similar libraries shows how
Cottle performs compared to other equivalent template engines.
